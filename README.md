# Ansible Vault client for KeePassXC

`vault-keepassxc-client` is a [client script for Ansible
Vault][ansible-vault-client-scripts] to work with
[KeePassXC][keepassxc]
([keepassxreboot/keepassxc][keepassxc-github]).
Passwords for vaults are retrieved from the password manager.

To remain a tiny tool [F. Zhang's `git-credential-keepassxc`
program][git-credential-keepassxc] is used. It uses KeePassXC's socket
protocol, originally written for web browser extensions.

## Usage

The client can be registered for individual vault IDs in `ansible.cfg`:

```ini
[defaults]
vault_identity_list = test1@/usr/local/bin/vault-keepassxc-client
```

The Git credential client needs to be configured
([documentation][git-credential-keepassxc-config]; caller limitations are left
as an exercise to the reader):

```shell
git-credential-keepassxc configure
```

Password entries in KeePassXC are recognized via URLs of the form
`ansible-vault://<vault_id>/`. They need to be in a group named `Ansible`. Such
entries can be configured manually or via the command line. Without
`--generate-random` the user is prompted for the password.

Example:

```shell
$ vault-keepassxc-client --vault-id test1 --generate-random --set
```

Read the password back:

```shell
$ vault-keepassxc-client --vault-id test1 --get
AbXy[â€¦]1234
```
